		- Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is **to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed**. The reverse process is called deserialization!
		- The [SerializeField] attribute is used **to mark non-public fields as serializable**: so that Unity can save and load those values (all public fields are serialized by default) even though they are not public. That's all it does. You use it when you want that.

	- #Awake
		- Awake is used to initialize any variables or game state before the game starts. Awake is called only once during the lifetime of the script instance. Awake is called after all objects are initialized so you can safely speak to other objects or query them using eg. GameObject. FindWithTag.
	- #GetComponent
		- GetComponent will return the first component that is found and the order is undefined. If you expect there to be more than one component of the same type, use gameObject. GetComponents instead, and cycle through the returned components testing for some unique property.
	- #Velocity
		- Velocity (v) equals Force (F) divided by mass (m) multiplied by time (t)
		- A velocity in Unity is units per second. The units are often thought of as metres but could be millimetres or light years. Unity velocity also **has the speed in X, Y, and Z defining the direction**.
